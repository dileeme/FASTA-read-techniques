all things FASTA

FASTA is a simple text-based format widely used in bioinformatics to represent nucleotide or amino acid sequences. Its straightforward structure makes it highly readable and compatible with various bioinformatics tools.

Structure of a FASTA File

A FASTA file typically consists of a series of records, each representing a single sequence. Each record has two parts:

Header Line:

Begins with a greater-than symbol (>).
Followed by a sequence identifier, which can be a unique identifier or a descriptive label.
May include additional information, such as the organism, gene name, or other relevant details.
Sequence Data:

Subsequent lines contain the actual sequence, represented by single-letter codes.
For DNA sequences, common codes are:
A: Adenine
C: Cytosine
G: Guanine
T: Thymine
For protein sequences, single-letter amino acid codes are used.
